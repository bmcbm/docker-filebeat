# Docker Filebeat image

Filebeat is a lightweight, open source shipper for log file data. As the next-generation Logstash Forwarder, Filebeat tails logs and quickly sends this information to Logstash for further parsing and enrichment or to Elasticsearch for centralized storage and analysis.

## Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

-	[`1.2.3`, `1.2`, `1`, `latest` (*Dockerfile*)](https://github.com/bmcbm/docker-filebeat/blob/master/1.2/Dockerfile)

## Build and update process

This image is automatically built at every push of this repository and every time that the `ubuntu:xenial` base image gets updated in order to ensure that bugfixes and security updates are immediately applied.

## Run

```
docker run -v /path/to/filebeat.yml:/filebeat.yml prima/filebeat:1
```

Or, you can create your own derived image, with the configuration in the image itself.

```dockerfile
FROM prima/filebeat
COPY my-config/filebeat.yml /filebeat.yml
```
